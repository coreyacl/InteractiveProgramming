We created a Pygame version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids.

## Results [~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples]

We ended up with a game that does a good job resembling the original game.

## Implementation [~2-3 paragraphs + UML diagram]

## Reflection [~2 paragraphs]


Please prepare a short document (~1 page not including figures) with the following sections:

Project Overview [Maximum 100 words]

Write a short abstract describing your project.

Results [~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples]

Present what you accomplished. This will be different for each project, but screenshots are likely to be helpful.

Implementation [~2-3 paragraphs + UML diagram]

Describe your implementation at a system architecture level. Include a UML class diagram, and talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice you did.

Reflection [~2 paragraphs]

From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?

Also discuss your team process in your reflection. How did you plan to divide the work (e.g. split by class, always pair program together, etc.) and how did it actually happen? Were there any issues that arose while working together, and how did you address them? What would you do differently next time?
